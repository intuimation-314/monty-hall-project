## 🎯 What is the Monty Hall Problem?

> You're shown multiple doors. One hides a **car 🚗**, others hide **goats 🐐**.  
> You pick one. Monty opens all but one goat door. Do you switch?

Statistically, **switching gives you a better chance** of winning.  
This program helps you test and see it yourself!
